It is a lovely day in UWaterloo and you are a magical goose.

All game assets, music, and programming were made over the course of 48 hours for the  UW Game Jam Fall 2024.

In this game you play as a magical goose capable of summoning spells. The goose has access to the four elements, rock, wet, wind, and hot and can combine them to make powerful attacks. Be careful though, as the more powerful they are the more they'll cost in mana. Your enemies will attack you too and the game works in real time so be quick on your flippers!
